Description:
	Project 2 is an implementation of the First Pass assembler in C. 
	The program reads in .SIC files and builds a symbol table using
	a hash table implementation. This symbol table is build using
	labels and address values from the .SIC program. Equipped with
	error handling, the program should be able to print the whole
	symbol table along with Start/End addresses.
	
Extra Credit:
	Yes.
	
Experience:
	I felt like this project was super straight forward. I kept a lot
	of the code from project 1, and implemented many of the string
	manipulation methods from project 1 in different ways. Error 
	stuff got a lot easier with project 1 done as well. Definitely
	confused a little on how C takes hex vs deci values, but I learned
	it's more how you print them, rather than the operations done.
	
Shortcomings:
	No shortcomings.
	
Improvements:
	Once again, I ask for a C debugger haha. I use Visual Studio
	and I cannot live without a debugger anymore. Using Visual Studio
	Code, I felt like I could've save MULTIPLE hours, if I could 
	simply put a breakpoint and step in/over methods, and watch 
	variables. There were a lot of dumb mistakes done that a debugger 
	would've pointed out immediately. I would say that if I had the debugger, 
	this project could've been done within 3 hours.
